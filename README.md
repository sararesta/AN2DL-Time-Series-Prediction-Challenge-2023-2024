In this homework, students are required to predict future samples of input time series. The objective is to design and implement forecasting models capable of leveraging past observations within the sequences to generate accurate predictions of future values. The task involves developing a forecasting model that can handle multiple uncorrelated time series. A key requirement is that the model demonstrates generalisation capabilities in the forecasting domain, enabling it to move beyond the limitations of specific time domains. Thus, the model should be specialised in forecasting while remaining adaptable rather than restricted to a single or predefined temporal context.
